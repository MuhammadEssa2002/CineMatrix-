# 🎬 CineMatrix – Real-Time 3D Matrix Multiplication in Cinema 4D

CineMatrix is a unique educational tool built inside **Cinema 4D** using the Python API. It allows users to **visually understand matrix multiplication** through interactive **3D animation**.

With CineMatrix, you define two matrices via **User Data**, and the system computes the result in real-time, animating the calculation process step-by-step. It's ideal for educators, students, or anyone who wants to grasp the logic of matrix multiplication in a visually engaging way.

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Input 2D matrices directly in Cinema 4D via User Data
- ⚙️ Calculates matrix product using Python
- 🎥 Real-time 3D animated visualization of the multiplication
- 🎓 Educational and interactive experience for linear algebra concepts
- 📦 Lightweight, fully scriptable within Cinema 4D

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Setup Matrices:**
   - Add your values for Matrix A and Matrix B using the User Data interface.

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Press the "Calculate" button to initiate multiplication.
   - The script computes the result and starts an animation showing the step-by-step multiplication process.

3. **Visual Output:**
   - Each step is displayed with 3D elements to represent matrix cells, operations, and the final output.

## 🧠 Educational Value

CineMatrix is designed to **bridge the gap between abstract math and visual learning**. By showing how rows interact with columns in a spatial, animated way, users gain a deeper understanding of:

- Dot products
- Matrix shapes and compatibility
- Computational logic behind multiplication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Cinema 4D R20 or later](https://www.maxon.net)
- Basic knowledge of Python inside C4D
- This script should be attached to a Null object or Python Tag

### Installation

1. Open your Cinema 4D project.
2. Create a new Null object.
3. Add User Data fields for Matrix A and Matrix B values.
4. Attach the provided Python script to a Python Tag on the Null.
5. Add a User Data Button to trigger the calculation.
